# Yahoo Exchange Rates

The rates are updated with a [shell script](https://github.com/ExchangeRates/Factory) that gets its rates from Yahoo.

This script runs on [VDM](https://www.vdm.io/) server 247, yet you can use the shell script on your own server with only minor ajustments. **That way you can also setup a repo like this and have full control over its stability.**
